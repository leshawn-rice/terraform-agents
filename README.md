# Azure Terraform Agent with Private Networking

This Terraform configuration deploys a dedicated Terraform agent in Microsoft Azure using Azure Container Instances (ACI), along with all necessary networking components to ensure secure, private operations. The setup includes the creation of an Azure Resource Group, a Virtual Network (VNet) with a designated subnet, and the deployment of the Terraform agent within this private network environment.

---

## Overview

The configuration is designed to:

- **Deploy a Terraform Agent:** Provision a dedicated resource (such as an ACI) to run Terraform operations securely.
- **Create a Private Network:** Set up an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and subnet to isolate the Terraform agent from public access.
- **Manage Resources:** Organize all infrastructure components within a dedicated Resource Group.
- **Enable Secure State Management:** Optionally configure a remote backend (via the `backend.tf` file) for secure Terraform state storage.

This configuration is ideal for organizations seeking to manage their infrastructure in a private, controlled environment on Azure.

---

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this configuration, ensure that you have:

- **Azure Subscription:** An active Azure account with sufficient permissions to create resources.
- **Terraform Installed:** Terraform version 0.12 or later (adjust based on your specific requirements).
- **Azure CLI:** Installed and authenticated to your Azure account.
- **Access Credentials:** Proper permissions for deploying resources, including the ability to create resource groups, virtual networks, and virtual machines (or other compute resources).

---

## File Structure

- **backend.tf:**  
  Configures the Terraform backend for remote state storage. Adjust this file if you wish to change the backend settings (e.g., using an Azure Storage Account).

- **locals.tf:**  
  Defines local variables that streamline resource configuration. These values are used throughout the configuration for consistency.

- **main.tf:**  
  Contains the primary resource definitions including:
  - The Azure Resource Group.
  - The Virtual Network and subnet setup.
  - The deployment resource for the Terraform agent.

- **providers.tf:**  
  Configures the Azure provider and any necessary provider settings for authenticating and interacting with Azure.

- **variables.tf:**  
  Defines the input variables for customizing the deployment (e.g., resource names, locations, VNet address space). These can be overridden via a `terraform.tfvars` file or directly on the command line.

---

## Customization

Before deploying, review and update the variables in `variables.tf` to suit your environment:

- **Resource Group Configuration:**
  - `resource_group_name`: The name for your Azure Resource Group.
  - `location`: The Azure region where the resources will be deployed.

- **Networking Setup:**
  - `vnet_name`: The name of the Virtual Network.
  - `vnet_address_space`: The CIDR block for the VNet.
  - `subnet_name`: The name of the subnet within the VNet.

- **Terraform Agent Configuration:**
  - `terraform_agent_name`: A unique name for your Terraform agent resource.
  - Additional settings such as VM size, image details, and any security configurations.

It is recommended to create a `terraform.tfvars` file with your specific values to override defaults.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Initialize the Terraform Workspace:**

   In the directory containing the configuration files, run:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Review and Customize Variables:**

    Edit the variables.tf (or create a terraform.tfvars file) to set your preferred values for resource names, location, networking details, and agent configuration.

3. **Plan the Deployment:**

    Generate an execution plan to preview the changes:

    ```sh
    terraform plan
    ```

4. **Apply the Configuration:**

    Deploy the resources to your Azure subscription:

    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```

    Confirm the prompt to proceed. Terraform will create the Resource Group, VNet, subnet, and deploy the Terraform agent.

5. **Verify Deployment:**

    After successful deployment, you can verify the created resources in the Azure Portal or using the Azure CLI.

---

## Maintenance and Usage
- **State Management:**
  Ensure that your Terraform state file is securedâ€”preferably using the remote backend configured in backend.tf.

- **Scaling and Modifications:**
  Adjust the input variables to scale or modify the deployment as needed. Changes can be applied using terraform apply.

- **Security Considerations:**
  Regularly review network security group (NSG) rules and access policies to maintain a secure environment.

---

## Cleanup
To remove all the resources created by this configuration, run:

  ```sh
  terraform destroy
  ```

Make sure to backup any critical data before destroying the infrastructure.
